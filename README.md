## Introduction

Machine learning is a fascinating field that involves developing algorithms capable of learning from data and making predictions or decisions. This repository aims to provide an educational resource for understanding and implementing various machine learning algorithms.

Each algorithm is implemented using Python and focuses on providing a clear and concise code structure. The implementation details and explanations are included within the code comments, making it easier to follow along and learn from.

## Algorithms

The repository currently includes the following machine learning algorithms:

- Linear Regression


Each algorithm is organized into its own directory, with separate Python files for the implementation and an example usage file that demonstrates how to apply the algorithm to a sample dataset.

## Usage

To use any of the algorithms, navigate to the specific algorithm's directory and follow the instructions provided in the README file within that directory. The README file will guide you through the necessary steps, including dependencies, dataset preparation, and running the code.

Feel free to explore different algorithms and modify the code to suit your specific needs. You can also contribute to the repository by adding new algorithms, improving existing implementations, or fixing any issues you come across.
